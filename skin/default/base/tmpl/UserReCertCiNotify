Dear databoss,

due to organisational changes of contacts in this Config-Item, you
need to recertificate these contacts. This can be done simply by
checking the record for correctness using the link below.
With this action the recertification is considered fulfilled!

If the recertification is not done by the databoss within 3 months, the 
Config-Item will be set to "disposte of wasted". As databoss you bear 
the consequences for this action!

You can reduce the frequency of such recertifications by adding 
only essential contacts and specifying groups as precise as posible.
