Dear databoss,

due organisational changes of contacts in the Config-Item, you
need to recertificate the contacts. This can be done, quiet simply by
checking the record of the link below this mail.

If the recertification is not done by the databoss within 3 months, the 
Config-Item will be set to "disposte of wasted". You should be aware
the consequences of this.

If you add the real needed contacts and specifiy groups precise as posible,
you can reduce the frequence of recertifications.
