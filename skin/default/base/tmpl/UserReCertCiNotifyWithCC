Dear databoss,

due to organisational changes of contacts in this Config-Item, you
need to recertificate these contacts. This can be done simply by
checking the record for correctness using the link below.
With this action the recertification is considered fulfilled!

If the recertification is not done by the databoss within 3 months, the 
Config-Item will be set to "disposte of wasted". As databoss you bear 
the consequences for this action!

You can reduce the frequency of such recertifications by adding 
only essential contacts and specifying groups as precise as posible.

@Colleagues in CC:
You have been contacted because the Databoss has NOT performed 
this validation on this config. item in the last 6 weeks! 
To prevent the config item from being set to 
disposed of waste status after three months without a check, 
please contact the Databoss. If the Databoss is unavailable, 
one of the colleagues with write rights in cc should take 
over the Databoss role for the time period and perform the 
validation (i.e., register themselves as the Databoss and 
check the config. item).
