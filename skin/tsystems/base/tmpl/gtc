Common policy for the usage of the W5Base/Darwin database system
================================================================
 
  
  §1  blocking of identifications/ contacts
      -------------------------------------
      The administration of W5Base/Darwin is authorized, in cases of careless 
      behaviour of users or by violation against the common policy to ban 
      the identifications. That means especially the efforts to affect the stability 
      system in a negative way or flooding the database with senseless information.

     
  §2  handling with the system
      ------------------------
      The W5Base/Darwin database system has to be used by the users only in the designated 
      way. The user is committed to take care of its access data, they have to be 
      reachable only for his personal usage. 
      Service identifications are only allowed to be used for designated application 
      interfaces. The usage of service identifier for regular, 
      none interface functionality is NOT allowed.

     
  §3  responsibility for data elements
      --------------------------------
      If a user creates data sets in the W5Base/Darwin database system, which are under 
      the assignment to a person in charge for data, so the user is responsible for 
      the data for an unlimited period of time. The handover of data to other users 
      (successors) is only in the authority of the person in charge for data.

     
  §4  data contents
      -------------
      Every User has the full responsibility for his created/modified data. 
      The saving of illegal, pornographic or racist contents is strictly prohibited.


  §5  export/ extraction of data
      --------------------------
      In the W5Base/Darwin Data bank system there are fort he user several methods to export 
      data. The usage of this function should be limited to the minimum for the official
      business. Forwarding of extracted data without the permission of W5Base/Darwin 
      administrators is strictly prohibited. Permission is only granted by using an 
      "Admin-Request".     
 

  §6  adjustment of rights
      --------------------
      Adjustment of rights, changes to groups, the assignment of contacts to certain 
      groups, requests for data rectifications or general questions to W5Base/Darwin/ Darwin 
      have to be formulated generally as "Admin-Requests". This can be found under 
      MyW5Base/Darwin ? "start new Workflow".  
   
     
  §7  adjustment of central data elements
      -----------------------------------
      The adjustment of central data elements e.g. location data, group labels, 
      mandates or the like, must be documented reasonably and clearly. Demands for 
      this will be processed only as "Admin-Request".

     
  §8  program adjustments and failure corrections in the W5Base/Darwin system
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Program technical adjustments, error messages, expansion requests or ideas for 
      new functions can be submitted with the workflow "ITIL request to the application 
      development". (application: W5Base/Darwin). For a continuous improvement process EVERY 
      user should report recognised bugs in the Web-Surface over the mentioned workflow.
